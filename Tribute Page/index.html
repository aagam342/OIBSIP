            Narendra Modi is an Indian politician and the current Prime Minister of India. He was born on September 17,
            1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat. Prior to becoming Prime Minister, he served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat for
            four consecutive terms. He is a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Modi is considered a
            master strategist for his party

            <h2 class="sections-heading">EARLY LIFE AND POLITICAL CAREER</h2>
            <p>Modi was raised in a small town in northern Gujarat, and he completed an M.A. degree in political science
                from Gujarat University in Ahmadabad. He joined the pro-Hindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
                organization
                in the early 1970s and set up a unit of the RSS’s students’ wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi
                Parishad, in
                his area. Modi rose steadily in the RSS hierarchy, and his association with the organization
                significantly
                benefited his subsequent political career. Modi joined the BJP in 1987, and a year later he was made the
                general secretary of the Gujarat branch of the party. He was instrumental in greatly strengthening the
                party’s presence in the state in succeeding years</p>
